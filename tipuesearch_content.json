To examine how a head deviates from a vertical axis we have to look at a plane number 7 in our 4th data model. This plane captures an orientation of the person's head and is orthonormal to a line between the chin and middle of the forehead. Possible deviations from the vertical axis can occur in two planes – one that reflects posterior-anterior tilt and one that reflects lateral tilt. Thus we need to check elevation angels for planar points ‘sp' and ‘su' that are used to define ‘spinal planes' in our data. Here ‘sp' points correspond to forward direction and ‘su' points to a left-hand direction. In our set up there is some uncertainty about position of markers relative to individual bodies because of the manual placement but also because of the idiosyncrasies and anatomical variations across individuals. Thus as an approximate reference we should provide angle values that were captured in the beginning of the form than a person is in a standing position. Below we refer to this time point as ‘2001' frame. Summary. Posterior-anterior tilt of the head According to description of an idealised movement we would expect all elevation angles to be around zero degree. However on average a head is tilted up around 9 degrees and the 1st group (students) shows about 3 degrees smaller tilt than the 2nd group (teachers). In two groups the means of angles that are grouped after the 11 sub-movements vary only about 1 degree whereas mean variations for angles that are grouped by the trial identities is about 6 degrees. This happens because the individual differences among trials within the same group and sub-movement cancel each other out than we group the values by the sub-movements. In other words, the head tilt seems to be independent from the movement phases on a group level and dependant on a level of individual trials. Than we look at individual time series for two symmetrical movements we can notice correlated changes within corresponding sub-movements in the most of the trials.

Lateral tilt of the head In the case of lateral deviations we would expect angles around zero with tilting to sides as an unbalanced reaction to a movement. On average head seems to be turned about 1.7 degrees to the right side in both groups. The range of sideward turns is about 10 degrees smaller than in upward and downward directions. Similarly to the anterior angles, means of angles that are grouped after the 11 sub-movements vary only about 0.8 degrees whereas mean variations for angles that are grouped by the trial identities are about 2.7 degrees. If for all intervals the values of the students' anterior angles were consistently smaller than angles of the 2nd group than the median values of the students' lateral angles are larger in the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th sub-movements. Furthermore, individual time series for the two time intervals with the symmetrical movements suggest a relation between changes in lateral orientation of the head and a direction of the stepping. Similarly to the anterior angles, these relations are highly individual and are difficult to generalise.

The 2nd and 3rd rows capture a symmetrical motion sequence: from the left into right bow stance and from the right into left. Posterior-anterior tilt of the head, grouped by id-trials and sub-movements Below are boxplots for two intervals of the 2nd step that capture symmetrical body motion: from the left to right bow stance and from the right to left bow stance. The boxplots of these intervals are superimposed for each of the trials. The 1st interval is marked by green color and the 2nd by red (color is not associated with groups). These boxplots suggest that the angle values for the two intervals don't reflect the symmetry of the actual movement. Also, we can differentiate between the different sub-movements within the two intervals and look at them individually. Below are two columns of the boxplots with 4 rows that represent consecutive phases of our two intervals. The 1st column represents the movement from the left to right bow stance (4th - 7th sub-movements), the 2nd column represents the movement from the right to left bow stance (8th - 11th sub-movements). We can notice that differences within the same trial are larger across the rows than across the columns. In other words, time intervals that mark movements that are physically different show a larger impact on the angle values than time intervals with similar movements. Furthermore we can compare the actual time series for the two intervals. The figure below shows 25 plots for each of the trials with the red color marking the 1st interval and green the 2nd. Vertical lines show boundaries for the four sub-movements within each interval, horizontal lines show means and a blue horizontal line marks the angle value in the 1st frame of the entire performance than a person is in a straight position. Horizontal axis is given in frames with sampling frequency 120 frames per second. Green is for the 1st interval (4-7th sub-movements; left to right bow stance); Red is for the 2nd interval (8-11th sub-movements; right to left bow stance). We can notice a clear correlation between the two intervals for some trials (e.g. ‘id_101', ‘id_204'). In trials like ‘id_205', ‘id_115' or ‘id_201' a timing of sub-movements within intervals is not matching but time series are nonetheless correlated. Similarly, we can see that there are few trials (e.g. ‘id_103', ‘id_114', ‘id_204') with a clear shift in the means of the intervals that might reperesent a left/right bias of an individual. It seems that for the most of the trials, anterior deviations of the head reflect the movement phases but these variations are highly individual.

The boxplots of these intervals are superimposed for each of the trials. The 1st interval is marked by green color and the 2nd by red (color is not associated with groups). Below are two columns of the boxplots with 4 rows that represent consecutive phases of our two intervals. The 1st column represents the movement from the left to right bow stance (4th - 7th sub-movements), the 2nd column represents the movement from the right to left bow stance (8th - 11th sub-movements). Furthermore we can compare the actual time series for the two intervals. The figure below shows 25 plots for each of the trials with the red color marking the 1st interval and green the 2nd. Vertical lines show boundaries for the four sub-movements within each interval, horizontal lines show means and a blue horizontal line marks the angle value in the 1st frame of the entire performance than a person is in a straight position. Horizontal axis is given in frames with sampling frequency 120 frames per second. Green is for the 1st interval (4-7th sub-movements; left to right bow stance); Red is for the 2nd interval (8-11th sub-movements; right to left bow stance). In some trials like ‘id_105', ‘id_111', ‘id_202' or ‘id_211' changes of the red lines are mirrored around the horizontal mean lines by the green line. In other words, if we take mean value as a ‘normal' orientation than for some people stepping from the left to right (red lines) and from the right to left bow stance (green lines) can be associated with a tilting of the head relative to their ‘normal vertical'. For example, in the trial ‘id_111', in the 4th sub-movement the head is straight and around 4 degrees turned leftwards relative to horizontal mean lines; in the 5th sub-movement (roll back to the right) the angle approaches the ‘normal' value and so the head is tilting to the right; in the 6th sub-movement that includes a mid swing stance of the right foot the head continues to turn rightwards but angle increases beyond the horizontal mean line and thus the head is tilted rightwards relative to the mean. Similarly the 2nd interval that is represented by the green line follows the movement and shows a mirrored relation to the angle changes in the 1st interval.","tags":"Summary Stats","title":"Lateral and anterior Movement of the Head"},{"url":"/articles/20160523/lateral-and-anterior-movement-of-the-neck/","text":"How does neck deviate from a vertical axis? To examine how a neck deviates from a vertical axis we have to look at a plane number 6 in our 4th data model. The 6th plane uses a reconstructed NECK marker (placement on a back bottom of the head where the head joins the neck) and is orthonormal to a line between NECK and C7 markers. Possible deviations from the vertical axis can occur in two planes – one that reflects posterior-anterior tilt and one that reflects lateral tilt. Thus we need to check elevation angels for planar points ‘sp' and ‘su' that are used to define ‘spinal planes' in our data. Here ‘sp' points correspond to forward direction and ‘su' points to a left-hand direction. In our set up there is some uncertainty about position of markers relative to individual bodies because of the manual placement but also because of the idiosyncrasies and anatomical variations across individuals. Thus as an approximate reference we should provide angle values that were captured in the beginning of the form than a person is in a standing position. Below we refer to this time point as ‘2001' frame. Summary. Posterior-anterior tilt of the neck If we take the straight standing posture in the beginning of a performance (event code 2001) as reference for the ‘normal' anterior angle of the neck then we can say that during the 2nd step of the form neck is tilted forward in both groups around 3.4 degrees in 1st group and 5 degrees in the 2nd with a standard deviation about 7 degrees. The overage values than data is grouped by trial identities or 11 sub-movements are about -16 degrees for both groups. Than we look at two intervals with the symmetrical movement we see behaviour similar to the head motion in sagittal plane. In most trials time series of the 1st and 2nd intervals seem to be correlated but amplitudes can be scaled.

Lateral tilt of the neck In the case of lateral deviations we would expect angles around zero with tilting to sides as a reaction to a movement. On average neck seems to be tilted about 7 and 2 degrees to the right side in 1st and 2nd group respectively. The range of values and standard deviation are quite large (+/- 50 degrees and about 20). The ‘normal' lateral angle of the neck seems to be right biased by about 1 degree in the 1st group. The lateral angles that are grouped by the trial identities suggest that there might be a right bias that was introduced by the movement but also individual biases towards the right side. However if we look at angles that are grouped after the 11 sub-movements we can notice that tilting to the left is present in the 5th to 8th sub-movements whereas the rest of the motion show a tilting towards right side. Furthermore, individual time series for the two time intervals with the symmetrical movements suggest a strong relation between changes in lateral orientation of the head and a direction of the stepping. Similarly to the lateral angles of the head, in most trials we can see that time series of the 1st and 2nd intervals are mirrored about the horizontal lines.

The boxplots of these intervals are superimposed for each of the trials. The 1st interval is marked by green color and the 2nd by red (color is not associated with groups). Also, we can differentiate between the different sub-movements within the two intervals and look at them individually. Below are two columns of the boxplots with 4 rows that represent consecutive phases of our two intervals. The 1st column represents the movement from the left to right bow stance (4th - 7th sub-movements), the 2nd column represents the movement from the right to left bow stance (8th - 11th sub-movements). Furthermore we can compare the actual time series for the two intervals. The figure below shows 25 plots for each of the trials with the red color marking the 1st interval and green the 2nd. Vertical lines show boundaries for the four sub-movements within each interval, horizontal lines show means and a blue horizontal line marks the angle value in the 1st frame of the entire performance than a person is in a straight position. Horizontal axis is given in frames with sampling frequency 120 frames per second. Green is for the 1st interval (4-7th sub-movements; left to right bow stance); Red is for the 2nd interval (8-11th sub-movements; right to left bow stance). We can notice a clear correlation between the two intervals for some trials (e.g. ‘id_101', ‘id_205'). In trials like ‘id_205' or ‘id_107' a timing of sub-movements within intervals is not matching but time series are nonetheless correlated. Similarly, we can see that there are few trials (e.g. ‘id_207' or ‘id_202') with a clear shift in the means of the intervals that might reperesent a left/right bias of an individual. It seems that for the most of the trials, anterior deviations of the neck reflect the movement phases but these variations are highly individual.

The 1st column represents the movement from the left to right bow stance (4th - 7th sub-movements), the 2nd column represents the movement from the right to left bow stance (8th - 11th sub-movements). The 1st sub-movements (1st row: 4th and 8th with the rollback back motion) are clearly showing that weight transfer to a rear leg introduces neck tilt to the side of the rear leg. In the second phase of the intervals (2nd row: 5th and 9th sub-movements) the weight is transferred onto the forward leg after it is turned to 45 degrees outside. In the student group we see that neck is laterally turning to the side of the forward leg but in the 1st interval (left to right bow stance) 2nd group seems to ‘overshoot' towards left side. In the 3rd phase of the intervals (3rd row: 6th and 10th sub-movements) there is a mid-swing stance and neck is tilted further towards the side of the support leg. And in the final phase of the intervals (4th row: 7th and 11th sub-movements) neck continues to be tilted towards the side of the forward leg that bears most of the body weight. Furthermore we can compare the actual time series for the two intervals. The figure below shows 25 plots for each of the trials with the red color marking the 1st interval and green the 2nd.

We need to look at elevation angles of the 2 planar points (‘sp' and ‘su') in the 5 spinal planes (1-5). We approximate a thoracic curve as difference in elevation angles of 5th and 4th spinal planes that are constructed based on the C7-T7 and T7-T12 spinal segments (sp5-sp4). For a lumbar curve we take a difference in elevation angles of 3rd and 2nd spinal planes that are constructed based on the T12-L4 and L4-mid pelvic spinal segments (sp3-sp2). Summary. Anterior angles in the thoracic and lumbar spinal areas In a sagittal plane a thoracic area of the spine has an outwards curve and as expected we have a range of negative angles between C7T7 and T7T12 spinal segments (sp5 - sp4 planes). In the starting standing position (‘2001' code) the 1st group has about 10 degrees larger min/max range of angles (20 vs. 9 degrees), a larger (about 3 degrees) standard deviation and only 2 degrees larger mean value than the 2nd group. Also the mean values in the 1st group for the movement are about 4.7 degrees larger than in the 2nd and the min/max range is about 32 versus 26 degrees. In other words, the thoracic curve seems to be less pronounced in the 2nd group than in the 1st. A lumbar area in a sagittal plane of the spine has an inwards curve and as expected we have a range of positive angles between T12L4 and L4Sacrum spinal segments (sp3 - sp2 planes). In the starting standing position (‘2001' code) the 1st group has slightly larger min/max range of angles (13.7 vs. 11.8 degrees) and an inwards curve about 1 degree whereas the 2nd group has a mean value for the outwards curve about 0.8 degrees. For the movement 1st group has about 5.6 degrees larger mean (15.2 vs. 9.6) and about 16 degrees larger value range (57 vs. 41). Similarly to the thoracic area, the 1st group seem to have more pronounced lumbar curve than the 2nd group. In other words, there is a difference between 1st and 2nd group, e.g. about 2 degrees difference in mean values in standing position that scales to differences of 4.7 and 5.56 degrees during the movement for thoracic and lumbar values respectively. Than data is grouped by trial identities we can notice that in most trials the difference between the curve value in standing position and mean value during the 2nd step of the Short Form is clearly larger for the thoracic curve than for the lumbar curve; the ‘id_203', ‘id_111' and ‘id_103' being exceptions. Also we can note that comparably to all trials, trials ‘id_114' and ‘id_112' have unusually large values for the thoracic curve whereas ‘id_211' shows an unusually small value. The lumbar curve seems to vary much stronger across trials than the thoracic curve. The trials ‘id_112' and ‘id_111' show extreme values: the former has outwards directed lumbar curve (negative values) and latter has large positive values (the normal inwards directed lumbar curve). Than the data is grouped by 11 sub-movements as expected we see a group difference for the range of values: 1st group has larger thoracic and lumbar curves across the 11 sub-movements than the 2nd group. The 5th and 6th sub-movements show the smallest mean differences for thoracic curve 2nd the largest. The lumbar curve in the 2nd group has an unusually small mean in the 1st sub-movement, a large mean difference in the 11th and 6th sub-movements and a small difference in the 5th, 2nd and 4th sub-movements. Than we look at two intervals with the symmetrical movement we see that within the trials the values in lumbar and thoracic curves are symmetrical in 1st and the 2nd intervals. Again the ‘id_114' trial has unusually large values and ‘id_211' small for thoracic curve. For lumbar curve ‘id_111' has very high values, ‘id_211', ‘id_204' and ‘id_205' small, and ‘id_112' outwards directed curve.

Lateral angles in the thorasic and lumbar areas In a coronal plane thoracic and lumbar areas of the spine should not show any tilting towards left or right sides. All negative results would indicate that we have an outwards-directed curve to the right (a left tilt) and positive values would mark an outwards curve to the left (a right tilt). As expected we have 1 and 0 degree mean thoracic values and 0.5 and -1 degree mean lumbar values for the 1st and 2nd group respectively. Notably, we have a 1 degree tilting leftwards for the thoracic curve in standing position (‘2001' code) in both groups. Also the ranges of thoracic values in the 1st group are biased by about 5 degrees towards leftward tilt and in the 2nd group towards the rightward tilt by about 2 degrees. For the ranges in lumbar values the 1st group shows a bias towards rightwards tilting by about 8 degrees. Than data is grouped by trial identities we can notice that thoracic values in trials ‘id_114' show comparatively large tilt rightwards; the lumbar values in trials ‘id_105', ‘id_112' and ‘id_208' show unusually large rightward tilting and ‘id_205', ‘id_115' and ‘id_206' a leftward tilt. Than the data is grouped by 11 sub-movements we see a general difference for the range of values: 1st group tend to have a rightward tilt in thoracic values apart from the 2nd and 10th sub-movements. The lumbar curves in the 9th, 10th and 11th sub-movements a rightwards tilt in the both groups. Whereas in the 1st, 2nd, and from the 4th, to 7th sub-movements both groups show the leftwards tilt. Than we look at two intervals with the symmetrical movement we see that within the trials the values in lumbar and thoracic curves are symmetrical in 1st and the 2nd intervals. Again the ‘id_114' trial has unusually large thoracic values in both intervals. Notably, within the individual trials the ranges of lumbar values are tighter than for thoracic and lumbar values for the 1st interval are always tilting more leftwards comparing to the second interval. In other words, it seems that the left to right bow stance stepping is associated with tendency to lean leftwards in the lumbar curve. Than we look at 4 phases of the 2 intervals we can notice that with exception of ‘id_112' and ‘id_204' the 1st and 3rd phases of two intervals (4th/8th and 6th/10th sub-movements) have tighter value ranges for the lumbar area than 2nd and 4th phases, e.g. there is less lumbar movement during these phases. Also within individual trials, the time series for thoracic and lumbar areas are symmetrical around horizontal lines between 1st and 2nd intervals.

We need to look at elevation angles of the 2 planar points (‘sp' and ‘su') in the 4th and 1st spinal planes. We take for the ribcage orientation a 'sp4' plane that is perpendicular to T7-T12 with the orientation that was defined by a marker on the bottom of the breastbone. Summary. Anterior orientation of the ribcage and pelvis The overage ribcage angles are about 3.6 and 0.3 degrees for the 1st and 2nd group with +/- 5 degrees. Notably, that is about 9 degrees lower than comparing to the starting position for both groups. For the pelvic angles we have small values (-0.8 and -2.5) with +/- 6 degrees and about 1 and 1.7 degrees lower comparing to the angles at the start position. Than data is grouped by trial identities means deviate more (about 3.6 and 2.5 degrees) than it is grouped by 11 sub-movements for both - ribcage and pelvis. For most of the trials the density plots (grouped by trial identities) look very similar for ribcage and pelvis angles but do show mean shifts. The pelvis and ribcage mean angles grouped by the 11 sub-movements are consistently lower in the 1st group than in the 2nd. Than we look at two intervals with the symmetrical movement we see that time series for the motion of the ribcage and pelvis in sagittal plane are clearly correlated between both intervals. In most of the trials there is an increase for the angles of pelvis angles in the 2nd motion phase of both intervals and increase in the 3rd. However, the shapes of the time series vary among individuals and are difficult to generalise.

Lateral orientation of the ribcage and pelvis In the case of lateral deviations we would expect angles around zero with tilting to sides as a reaction to a movement. On average ribcage and pelvis in both groups are around 0 degrees with +/- 3.2 and 4.6 degrees for ribcage (1st and 2nd group) and +/- 3.5 degrees for pelvis. The ‘normal' lateral angle of the ribcage in the starting position seems to be left biased (leftwards tilted) by about 1 degree in both groups. The lateral angles that are grouped by the trial identities suggest that there might be a leftwards bias for the 'normal' orientation of the ribcage in some trials. The ribcage angles that are grouped after the 11 sub-movements show tilting to the left in the 9th to 10th sub-movements and to the right in 5th and 6th. The pelvis angles have a left tilt in 6th sub-movement and to the right in 2nd and 10th. Furthermore, individual time series for the two time intervals with the symmetrical movements we see that in most of the trials the time series for the motion of the ribcage and pelvis in sagittal plane are mirrored about vertical lines in both intervals.

We need to look at shoulders representations that are given by two lines that connect marker (STRN) at top area of a breast bone (sternum) and bony parts of left and right shoulder joints (RSH and LSH markers placed at parts of the scapula that forms the highest points of the shoulders). These two lines (for right and left) reflect motion of the shoulders and in a 1st place of clavicles. Thus we can estimate amount of the protraction/retraction in the shoulder by looking at azimuth angles between the lines and ribcage. As anatomically the angle between clavicles is directed outwards, the smaller value of the angle between the clavicle line and forward orientation of the ribcage will correspond to the forwards motion of the shoulder (protraction) and higher angle to the backwards motion (retraction). For the ribcage representation we take the spinal plane that represents the upper part of the ribcage (5th). This plane models a part between C7 to T7 vertebras, is perpendicular to the C7T7 line with the forward orientation that is defined by the STRN marker. Thus the azimuth angles are given by the forward points of the plane (sp5_1). Summary. Relative orientation of the clavicles in the horisontal plane The difference in azimuth angles (sp5_1-RSH_1 and LSH_1-sp5_1) are measured relatively to the forward direction of the 5th spinal plane and normalised to take positive values between 0 and 180 degrees. These values are angles from the right and left shoulder to the mid centere on the right and left sides respectively. The 2nd step of the Short Form has 3 intervals with last two being identical motion sequence: one on the left and one on right side. In contrast the 1st interval involves a full body turn in space by 90 degrees leftwards and thus we don't include this movement in the summary of the azimuth angles to avoid possible left/right biases. For the azimuth angles in the 4th to 11 sub-movements we can see that 1st group has a slightly higher mean value (around 2 degrees) than the 2nd for the right clavicle and about the same mean for the left clavicle. In the beginning of trials (2001-code) than person is standing, both groups seem to have about 2-3 degrees larger angles or in other words on average shoulder were more retracted in the static posture comparing to the summarised motion intervals. The range of values is bigger in the 2nd group for the right shoulder but for the left side maximum protraction value seems to be higher (94.1 vs. 87.34 degrees). The mean values between right and left are slightly higher in the 2nd group (about 3 degrees) and the minimum value is about 10 degrees smaller than in the 1st group (119.3 vs. 108.8 degrees). As the right and left clavicles form an angle that is bigger than 180 degrees from the front, its normalised value (RSH-LSH) corresponds to the positive angle from the back and is smaller than 180 degrees.

Than data is grouped by 11 sub-movements we can notice that the 1st group has higher values for the right shoulder across all sub-movements (green boxplots are shifted leftwards towards smaller angles comparing to the red boxplots). However the left side is much less differentiable between 1st and 2nd group. Than data is grouped by two intervals we can see that in all trials right clavicle in the 1st interval has wider and smaller range of values (green boxplots for right) that approximates values for the left clavicle in the 2nd interval (red boxplots in for left) and vice versa. This is expected as movement of the left and right arms are switched in the 1st and 2nd intervals. Furthermore in the 2 x 4 panel of the boxplots for the 4 phases of two intervals we can notice that one of the shoulders clearly moves more and has smaller values (is less retracted) than the other (right shoulder in the 1st interval and left in the 2nd); e.g. in 1st column brown and green boxplots have wide range of values and in the 2nd column wider ranges are taken by pale green and yellow boxplots. Also in most trials in the 1st and last phases (4th, 8th, 7th and 11th sub-movements) both shoulders move more than in the 2 mid phases of the intervals. The time series of the difference angle between right and left clavicles seem to be correlated between 1st and 2nd interval within most of the trials (olive and dark pink lines). They also seem to be correlated with the difference between the angles that measure the relation of clavicles and the midline of the body (the forward orientation of the ribcage) or in other words these are the values that we get than we subtract time series of the right clavicle angles from the time series of the left clavicle angles from the previous plot panel (red minus orange and dark green minus light green). This correlation is positive for the 1st interval and negative for the 2nd (green and olive line for the 1st, pink and red lines for the 2nd). In the 3rd plot panel than we compare the difference values (green and red lines for the 1st and 2nd intervals) with the orientation of the ribcage (light and dark grey for the 1st and 2nd intervals) it seems that in most of the trials these values are connected. As the ribcage turns to the left side in the 1st interval (light grey, positive values) right shoulder tends to move more forward (dark green, positive values) and vice versa for the right turn of the ribcage in the 2nd interval.

Brown color represents the 1st group and green the 2nd; vertical lines mark mean value of the corresponding sub-movement for 1st and 2nd group. The 2nd and 3rd rows capture a symmetrical motion sequence: from the left into right bow stance and from the right into left. Relative orientation of the clavicles in the horisontal plane, grouped by id-trials and sub-movements Below are boxplots for two intervals of the 2nd step that capture symmetrical body motion: from the left to right bow stance and from the right to left bow stance. The boxplots of these intervals are superimposed for each of the trials. The 1st interval is marked by green color and the 2nd by red (color is not associated with groups). Also, we can differentiate between the different sub-movements within the two intervals and look at them individually. Below are two columns of the boxplots with 4 rows that represent consecutive phases of our two intervals. The 1st column represents the movement from the left to right bow stance (4th - 7th sub-movements), the 2nd column represents the movement from the right to left bow stance (8th - 11th sub-movements). Brown and green color mark data of the angles for the right clavicle in the 1st and 2nd group. Pale semi-transparent yellow and cyan-green colors mark angles of the left clavicle for the 1st and 2nd group. Furthermore we can compare the actual time series for the two intervals. The figure below shows 25 plots for each of the trials with the red/orange color marking the 2nd interval and green the 1st. Vertical lines show boundaries for the four sub-movements within each interval; horizontal lines show right (green) and left (dark green) angles in the 1st frame of the trial than a person is in a straight position; and a blue horizontal line marks their difference in this 1st frame of the trial. Horizontal axis is given in frames with sampling frequency 120 frames per second. Green colors are for the 1st interval (4-7th sub-movements; left to right bow stance) and red-like for the 2nd interval (8-11th sub-movements; right to left bow stance); darker colors are for the left clavicle and lighter colors for the right clavicle. Right side (1-green & 2-orange), Left side (1-dark green & 2-red) Below are the time series for the difference between the right and left clavicles ((LSH_1-sp5_1)-(sp5_1-RSH_1)) in relation to the ribcage; in other words these values represent the motion of the shoulders only. Time series for the 1st interval are in the green color and for the 2nd interval in the red color. The positive value indicates that the right shoulder is closer to the body midline (more protracted) than the left shoulder. The lines in the light grey color represent azimuth angles of the ribcage in the 1st interval and in the dark grey in the 2nd. The olive and pink colors mark absolute angle between clavicle lines in the horisontal plane (RSH-LSH) for the 1st and 2nd intervals respectively. As the ribcage turns to the left side in the 1st interval (light grey, positive values) right shoulder moves more forward (dark green, positive values) and vice versa for the right turn in the 2nd interval. The absolute angle between clavicles (olive and pink lines) increases in as shoulders gets more inwards (closer to each other). This happens because this angle is normalised and shows an angle between clavicle lines that anatomically is a convex angle from the back of the body. Thus protraction of any shoulder increases its value.

We need to look at upper arm representations that are given by two lines that connect marker bony parts of the shoulder joints (RSH and LSH) and mid elbow markers (mRELBOW and mLELBOW). These two lines (for right and left) reflect motion of the upper arms. Thus we can estimate their vertical movement in relation to the ribcage by looking at elevation angles between the ribcage and these lines. For the ribcage representation we take the spinal plane that represents the mid part of the ribcage (4th). This plane models a part between T7 to T12 vertebras, is perpendicular to the T12L4 line with the forward orientation that is defined by the bottom sternum marker. Thus the elevation angles are given by the 'su' points that define a lateral tilt of the ribcage (su4_2). As the 'su' points are defined on the left side of the body (positive Y-axis) we need to calculate left and right angles differently to get an estimate of how left and right upper arms are moving up and down relatively to the ribcage. For the left side we use (mLELBOW_2 - su4_2) and the right side (mRELBOW_2 + su4_2). Summary. Motion of the upper arms relative to the vertical orientation of the ribcage The difference in the elevation angles (mRELBOW_2-su4_2 and mLELBOW_2-su4_2) are measured relatively to the lateral elevation angle of the 4th spinal plane. So for example positive value for the arm indicates that the upper arm and the ribcage build an upward angle (the arm is raised up) whereas negative value indicate the downward angle; in other words the increasing positive value and the decreasing negative value corresponds to the upwards motion of the arm and the reverse to the downwards motion of the arm. For the elevation angles in the 11 sub-movements we can see that in the 1st group the arms are more down (about 1 degrees) than in the 2nd and in both groups the left arm is more down (about 7.7 and 5.6 degrees in the 1st and 2nd groups correspondingly). This difference is likely to be rooted in the fact that than the sub-movements from 4th to 11th are symmetrical, the sub-movements from 1st to 3rd have the right arm higher than the left.

In the density plots that take only 2 symmetrical intervals (4th-11th sub-movements) we can notice that most of the trials have 2 small peaks for the left and right sides that might be connected to the fact that we have 2 prominent positions for the arms: reaching forward at chest level and being down. Than data is grouped by 11 sub-movements as expected we can notice that arm values vary depending on the sub-movements and that the right upper arm in the 3th-7th sub-movements is lover in the 1st group than in the 2nd. For the 1st, 2nd, 9th and 10th sub-movements the right arm is lower in the 2nd group. The left arm in the 1st-4th, 11th, 8th and 9th sub-movements is lover in the 1st group than in the 2nd. The density plots describe the situation more clearly; as expected we see similarities between two laterally symmetrical intervals: 2nd row for the right resembles the 3rd row for the left (also the 1st for the left) and 3rd row for the right (with the 1st row except the 1st sub-movement ‘m_1') resembles the 2nd row for the left. We also can notice that the forward reaching arm (the right arm in the 1st interval, 2nd row and the left arm in the 2nd interval, 3rd row) is higher in the 2nd group than in the 1st group. In contrast the arm that is directed down (the right arm in the 2nd interval, 3rd row and the left arm in the 1st interval, 2nd row) is higher in the 1st group than in the 2nd group. Similarly than data is grouped by two intervals we can see that values for the right arm are consistently higher in the 1st interval (e.g. all red boxplots are shifted to the right from the green boxplots). And reversely values for the left arm are higher in the 2nd interval (e.g. all green boxplots are shifted to the right from the green boxplots). These relations can be explained by the lateral symmetry of the movements in 2 intervals: movement of the right arm in the 1st becomes movement of the left in the 2nd interval and vice versa. Even more clearly we can see this in the 4 x 2 boxplot panel for each of the 4 phases of the intervals. Also we can see how within one interval position of the arms swap with each other and the arm that was down becomes forward reaching and vice versa. In the last phase of intervals there is clearly more vertical movement for the forward reaching arm than the other (the right for the 1st and left for 2nd interval). Furthermore if we look at time series we can notice in most of the trials a clear correlation between the right and left arms in two intervals (light green and red, orange and dark green). In the next plot panel we can see how the difference angle between elevation angles of the right and left upper arms (olive for the 1st interval and pink for the 2nd) and the lateral elevation angles of the ribcage (light and dark grey for the 1st and 2nd intervals) look like.

The 1st row is for the right and left angles relative to lateral tilting of the ribcage and the 2nd row is for the difference between right and left shoulders and for the lateral tilting of the ribcage.

We need to look at upper arm representations that are given by two lines that connect marker bony parts of the shoulder joints (RSH and LSH) and mid elbow markers (mRELBOW and mLELBOW). These two lines (for right and left) reflect motion of the upper arms. Thus we can estimate their movement in horizontal plane relatively to the ribcage by looking at azimuth angles of these lines and the ribcage. For the ribcage representation we take the spinal plane that represents the mid part of the ribcage (4th plane). This plane models a part between T7 to T12 vertebras, is perpendicular to the T12L4 line with the forward orientation that is defined by the bottom sternum marker. The azimuth angles are given by the forward points of the plane (sp4_1). Summary. Relative orientation of the upper arms in the horisontal plane The difference in azimuth angles (sp4_1-mRELBOW_1 and mLELBOW_1-sp4_1) are measured relatively to the forward direction of the 4th spinal plane and normalised to take positive values between 0 and 180 degrees. These values are angles from the right and left body upper arms to the mid centre on the right and left sides respectively. The 2nd step of the Short Form has 3 intervals with last two being identical motion sequence: one on the left and one on right side. In contrast the 1st interval involves a full body turn in space by 90 degrees leftwards and thus we don't include this movement in the summary of the azimuth angles to simplify the matter. For the azimuth angles in the 4th to 11 sub-movements we can see that the 1st group has a slightly higher mean value (around 3 degrees) than the 2nd group for the right upper arm and about 10 degrees higher for the left arm. It also seems that in the 1st group max values are about 25 degrees higher and this might indicate that in the position than the elbow is pointing to the sides and backwards the upper arm is much closer to the body in the 1st group than in the 2nd. Similarly the absolute minimum values in the 1st group are about 15 degrees higher and might indicate that in the positions than the arm crosses the midline of the body the upper arm is closer to the torso in the 1st group than in the 2nd.

Also the 2nd group mean values for the left arm seem to be about 10 degrees smaller than in the 1st group and for the right arm in both groups. Than data is grouped by 11 sub-movements we can notice the lateral symmetry between 4th to 7th and 8th to 11th sub-movements. Boxplots for the right arm in the 1st interval are similar to boxplots for the left arm in the 2nd interval and vice versa; it also clearly shows that different sub-movements involve different amount of the movement in upper arms. Also this movement symmetry in 1st and 2nd intervals is clearly visible in the density plots. However than data is grouped by two intervals we also can see that despite the symmetry in the movement all trials have slight differences between corresponding movements of the left and right arms in 2 intervals. For example ‘id_211' the values ranges for the right upper arm in the 1st interval (green boxplot in the panel for the right side) are slightly wider and have about 7 degrees higher mean than values for the left arm in the 2nd interval (red boxplot in the panel for the left side). The symmetry and these deviations from it become even more visible in the 2 x 4 boxplots panel for 4 phases of the intervals. We also can notice the general trend: the right upper arms moves more than the left in the 1st phase and more or less in the 2nd phase of the 1st interval whereas the left upper arm moves more in the last phase of the 1st interval; the same logic applies for the 2nd interval (2nd column of the boxplots). Nonetheless different trials seem to have different strategies to distribute the movement between the left and right arms; e.g. ‘id_207' in the 3rd phase displays more movement in the arm that goes down (left for the 1st interval, right for the 2nd) but ‘id_102' displays a reversed logic. Also the clear preference for the more movement of the arm that goes down in the last phase of the intervals (left for the 1st interval, right for the 2nd) is different to the movement of the clavicles in the horizontal plane in the same phase as it displayed more movement in the shoulder of the arm that was reaching forwards. The time series for the angles between the upper arms and midline of the body (the orientation of the ribcage) indicate the difference between the motion of the left and right arms within the same interval (light green vs. orange and dark green vs. red, e.g. ‘id_114'). However the left/right bias is present in most of the trials and we can see it in the 2nd plot panel at the hand of the differences between these left and right angles to the midline in the 1st and 2nd intervals (dark green vs. red lines); e.g. ‘id_114' has negatively correlated lines symmetrical to the horizontal axis, ‘id_204' has lines with similar shape for the same phases of the both intervals but the horizontal symmetry line is about 25 degrees. For the latter example if we look at the previous plot panel we can see that in the ‘id_204' the left arm in the 2nd interval (red line) has a wider angle than the right arm in the 1st interval thus than we subtract the left values from the right (dark green minus light green and red minus orange) we get a higher result. In other words, this case describes a situation with the forward reaching arm being closer to the body midline in the horizontal plane then it is the right upper arm rather than the left arm. The example of an opposite case is ‘id_206' with the reaching arm being closer to the midline than it is the left arm but also with the arm that moves downwards being closer to the midline than it is the right arm. Also these differences can be noticed at the hand of the angle between the both upper arms (mRELBOW-mLELBOW) that was calculated without any relation to the orientation of the ribcage (olive and pink lines). Depending on the spatial orientation of the arms this angle can indicate the angle from the forward or back directions with the values that are not easily interpretable in the movement terms; nonetheless they clearly mark the differences between the arm movements in the 1st and 2nd intervals across the trials. The 3rd plot panel shows the differences between the left and right angles to the midline in the 1st and 2nd intervals (dark green vs. red lines) together with the changes in the orientation of the ribcage (light grey lines for the 1st interval and dark grey for the 2nd). Relative orientation of the upper arms in the horisontal plane, grouped by id-trials Below are boxplots of the upper arm angles relative to the ribcage across different trials for the 4th to 11th sub-movements in the 2nd step of the Short Form.

The boxplots of these intervals are superimposed for each of the trials. The 1st interval is marked by green color and the 2nd by red (color is not associated with groups). Also, we can differentiate between the different sub-movements within the two intervals and look at them individually.

We need to look at shoulders representations that are given by two lines that connect marker (STRN) at top area of a breast bone (sternum) and bony parts of left and right shoulder joints (RSH and LSH markers placed at parts of the scapula that forms the highest points of the shoulders). These two lines (for right and left) reflect motion of the shoulders and in a 1st place of clavicles. Thus we can estimate amount of elevation/depression in the shoulder motion by looking at elevation angles between the ribcage and these lines. For the ribcage representation we take the spinal plane that represents the upper part of the ribcage (5th). This plane models a part between C7 to T7 vertebras, is perpendicular to the C7T7 line with the forward orientation that is defined by the STRN marker. Thus the elevation angles are given by the 'su' points that define a lateral tilt of the ribcage (su5_2). As the 'su' points are defined on the left side of the body (positive Y-axis) we need to calculate left and right angles differently to get an estimate of how left and right shoulders are moving up and down relatively to the ribcage. For the left side we use (LSH_2 - su5_2) and the right side (RSH_2 + su5_2). Summary. Motion of the clavicles relative to the vertical orientation of the ribcage The difference in elevation angles (RSH_2-su5_2 and LSH_2-su5_2) are measured relatively to the lateral elevation angle of the 5th spinal plane. So for example positive value for the clavicle indicates that clavicle line and the ribcage build an upwards angle whereas negative value is indicating the downwards angle; in other words the former corresponds to the upwards motion of the shoulder (elevation) and the latter an downwards motion (depression). It is important to note that anatomically every person will have different values for these angles in the neutral position that we can estimate by looking at the values in the standing position at the beginning of the trial (2001-code). The symmetry of the shoulders is estimated in absolute coordinate frame by subtracting elevation angle of the right clavicle line from the left clavicle (RSH_2 - LSH_2). The positive value would correspond to the higher right shoulder and negative to the higher left without considering the orientation of the ribcage. For the elevation angles in the 11 sub-movements we can see that 1st group has a slightly smaller mean value (around 1.5 degrees) than the 2nd for the both clavicles. In the beginning of trials (2001-code) than person is standing, both groups seem to have smaller angles (about 7.6/6.9 degrees for right and 4.9/4.6 for the left) or in other words on average shoulder were less elevated in the static posture comparing to the summarised motion intervals. The means of differences between right and left sides are has small values (0.8 for the 1st group and 2.3 degrees for the 2nd); e.g. right shoulder seems to be slightly more up in the 2nd group.

So in the density plots we can notice that trials in the 2nd group have their peaks for the left and right sides close to each other (except ‘id_201' and ‘id_206') whereas in the1st group more trials seem to have differences in the their vertical movement in the left and right shoulders. Than data is grouped by 11 sub-movements we can notice that the 1st group has wider range values for both sides and across different sub-movements; e.g. green boxplots are positioned slightly more rightwards towards the higher angles comparing to the red boxplots and are less wide. Also density plots for the left clavicle in 2nd interval (3rd row) seems to differ more from the density plots of the right clavicle in the 1st interval (2nd row) in the 1st group than in the 2nd group. As these 2 intervals capture symmetrical movement the right shoulder in the 1st interval should match the left in the 2nd and vice versa. It seems that the vertical shoulder motion of the more moving arm (right in the 1st interval and left in the 2nd interval) is more uniform in the 2nd group than in the 1st. However the vertical shoulder motion of the less moving arm seems to be more similar among the 1st group than the 2nd; e.g. green density plots for the right shoulder in the 3rd row are less similar with the green density plots for the left shoulder in the 2nd row than corresponding brown density plots. Than data is grouped by two intervals we can see that in a contrast to the protraction and retraction motion in 2 intervals that showed more movement for one shoulder, the vertical motion of the shoulders is more or less equal in the intervals. Also as expected we can notice that most of the values are positive because mean of ‘normal' angles in a resting position are around 4-5 degrees higher than the ribcage plane. Thus values smaller than -5 degrees for the less moving arm in ‘id_211' seem to be rather extreme. In the time series the light green lines should be close with the dark red lines as a movement of the right arm in the 1st interval (light green) is the same as a movement of the left arm in the 2nd interval (red); and reversely, the orange lines should match the dark green lines. However we can see that it is rarely the case; in some trials there is an offset in values (e.g. left shoulder in ‘id_206', ‘id_114' orange and dark green) or shape of the curves is different (e.g. right shoulder in ‘id_204', light green and red). Also it is noticeable that some trials have a left or right bias, e.g. ‘id_101' or ‘id_207' have in standing position the right shoulder higher than the left (marked by horizontal light green and orange lines). Furthermore if we look at time series of the difference angle between right and left shoulder in absolute the lab system frame and at the lateral elevation angles of the ribcage we would expect that they would be negatively correlated because if the ribcage is tilted to the right (positive angles) the right shoulder will be lower than the left. A shoulder can move up and downwards independently of the orientation of the ribcage but it is less common to elevate the shoulder than tilting towards its lateral side. As expected we can see in the 2nd panel with time series this negative correlation; e.g. the olive green and light grey lines for the 1st interval and dark pink and grey for the 2nd interval (very clear example is ‘id_205' and some exception in the 2nd interval for ‘id_211'). However amplitude of the shoulder movement seems to be higher than of the ribcage for most of the cases and if we sum negatively correlated time series (RSH_2-LSH_2+su5_2) we get time series for the differences between elevation/depression motion between the right and left shoulders in the 1st and 2nd intervals ( 3rd last panel with the time series). As expected 1st and 2nd intervals (olive and dark pink) are symmetrical along horizontal lines for the most of the trials.

We need to look at azimuth angles (and more importantly their difference) of the ‘sp' planar points in the 4th and 1st spinal planes. We take for the ribcage orientation a 'sp4' plane that is perpendicular to T7-T12 with the orientation that was defined by a marker on the bottom of the breastbone. Summary. Orientation of the ribcage and pelvis in the horisontal plane The azimuth angles are measured in the absolute coordinate frame so that 0 degree angle corresponds to the X-axis direction and positive angles correspond to the anticlockwise turns or leftwards direction if the body is facing direction of the X-axis. In the 1st, 2nd and 3rd sub-movements in the 2nd step of the Short Form the body turns from the negative direction of the Y-axis to the positive direction of the X-axis whereas in from the 4th to 11th sub-movements locomotion is in the positive direction of the X-axis and turning to the left corresponds to positive azimuth angles and turning to the right to the negative. As expected the mean value of the difference between the orientation of the ribcage and pelvis (Pelvis – Ribcage) is around 0 degrees. The range of this difference is about 5 degrees higher in the 2nd group than in the 1st (about 41 degrees for the 1st and 46 for the 2nd). If we look at value ranges for the pelvis and ribcage we can notice that the pelvis has much higher range than the ribcage in the 2nd group: 100.5 degrees vs. 108.9 for the pelvis and 120.7 vs. 123.8 for the ribcage. Thus it is likely that the 5 degrees for the differences in the pelvis and ribcage orientations (Pelvis – Ribcage) are connected with the more movement in the pelvis. The overage ribcage angles in the 4th to 11th sub-movements are about 1.4 degree to the right in the 1st group and 2 degrees to the left in the 2nd. In the beginning of the Form (2001 code) both groups are oriented slightly rightwards: the 1st group shows the same 1.4 degrees to the right (-91.43) whereas the 2nd group has 1.9 degrees to the right (-91.9). The overage pelvic angles in the 4th to 11th sub-movements are about 0.6 degree to the right in the 1st group and 1.2 degrees to the left in the 2nd. In the beginning of the Form (2001 code) both groups are oriented slightly rightwards: the 1st group shows the same 0.8 degrees to the right (-90.75) whereas the 2nd group has 2.2 degrees to the right (-92.23). Than data is grouped by trial identities the 1st group continues to have the mean values for the ribcage and pelvis slightly rightwards (-1.5 degree and -0.8 degrees) whereas the 2nd group slightly leftwards (1.9 degrees and 1.4 degrees). For the 2nd group also the range of values seems to be biased towards the left side; in the 1st group minimum (right side) and maximum (left side) values are more or less symmetrical (7.7 vs. -7.9 for the ribcage and 7.95 vs.-7.5 for the pelvis) whereas in the 2nd group we see almost 3 times higher values for the left side (8.97 vs. -3.69 for ribcage and 11.5 vs. -4.7 for the pelvis). The range of the pelvic turning is about 16.2 degrees in the 2nd group and 15.5 in the 1st group. However, the range of the ribcage turning is higher for the 1st group; it is about 12.7 degrees in the 2nd group and 15.6 in the 1st group. The maximum value for the difference between the orientation of the pelvis and ribcage (Pelvis – Ribcage) is slightly higher for the 2nd group: 5.3 vs. 8.2 degree.

In the density plots we can notice that 4th and 8th sub-movements (m_4 and m_8) with a roll back movement have their mean values around 0 degree for the pelvis and ribcage whereas the 5th to 7th sub-movements are on the right side and 9th to 11th on the left side. The latter is expected and reflects the symmetry of the 2 intervals: the left bow stance into the right (4th-7th) and the right bow stance into the left (8th-11th). Moreover than we look at two intervals with the symmetrical movement we see the same picture: the ribcage and pelvis are turned rightwards in the 1st interval (green color in boxplots) and leftwards in the 2nd interval (red color). Furthermore as we look at the boxplots for each of the 8 sub-movements in the 2 symmetrical intervals we can see that the 1st phases (4th and 8th sub-movements) have most spread value ranges followed by the last phases (7th and 11th). In both – 1st and last phases pelvic and ribcage value ranges seem to have overlaps. The 2 phases in the middle of the intervals (2nd and 3rd rows, 5th, 6th, 8th and 9th) have more limited value ranges with some trials without or small overlaps between pelvic and ribcage values. The none-overlap seems to occur in the cases than the pelvis and ribcage are continuously turning with a large enough offset in relation to each other (e.g. 3rd phase in the time series for the trial ‘id_211'). Most of the time in all trials time series for the turning of the ribcage and pelvis show that the amplitude of the ribcage is higher than of the pelvis and that their motions are clearly correlated with each other within the same interval and mirrored along horizontal lines between both intervals. If there is a change between the left and right orientations within one interval than it occurs only in the 1st phase of the interval; so in absolute coordinate frame in the 1st interval (green lines) the pelvis and ribcage turn from the right to left (4th sub-movement, 1st phase of the interval) and correspondingly in the 2nd interval they turn from the left to right (8th sub-movement, 1st phase). The relative changes in the directions of the turning within the same interval seem to vary among the trials; so ‘id_206' changes the direction 2 times in the 1st interval: in the middle of the 1st phase, at the end of the 2nd phase whereas ‘id_111' changes the direction 4 times. The change in the speed of the turning motion in the pelvis or ribcage is marked by the peak values of the dark olive and pink lines that represent the difference between the orientations of the pelvis and ribcage (pelvis – ribcage); in most of the trials they occur in around the middle of the 2nd phase (5th and 9th sub-movements) and at the boundaries between 2nd /3rd and 3rd/4th (end of 5th, 6th, 9th and 10th).

Brown color represents the 1st group and green the 2nd. Horizontal axes are given in degrees of the azimuth angles so that positive values correspond to turning leftwards from positive direction of X-axis.

Brown color represents the ribcage angles for the 1st group and light green the 2nd; vertical lines mark mean value of the corresponding trials. The orange color represents the pelvis angles for the 1st group and dark green the 2nd; vertical lines mark mean value of the corresponding trials. Dark pink color represents the difference angle between the orientation of pelvis and ribcage. Blue vertical lines mark summ of the angle values in the beginning of the form and 90 degrees angle so that an orientation of the starting posture is changed from negative direction of the Y-axis in lab coordinate system (corresponds to the azimuth of -90 degrees) to the positive direction of the X-axis (0 degree). The dotted blue line marks a pelvis orientation whereas the continius blue lines a ribcage orientation.

Brown color represents the 1st group and green the 2nd; vertical lines mark mean value of the corresponding sub-movement for 1st and 2nd group. The 2nd and 3rd rows capture a symmetrical motion sequence: from the left into right bow stance and from the right into left. Orientation of the ribcage and pelvis in the horisontal plane, grouped by id-trials and sub-movements Below are boxplots for two intervals of the 2nd step that capture symmetrical body motion: from the left to right bow stance and from the right to left bow stance. The boxplots of these intervals are superimposed for each of the trials. The 1st interval is marked by green color and the 2nd by red (color is not associated with groups). Also, we can differentiate between the different sub-movements within the two intervals and look at them individually. Below are two columns of the boxplots with 4 rows that represent consecutive phases of our two intervals. The 1st column represents the movement from the left to right bow stance (4th - 7th sub-movements), the 2nd column represents the movement from the right to left bow stance (8th - 11th sub-movements). Brown and green color mark data of the ribcage angles for the 1st and 2nd group. Pale semi-transparent yellow and cyan-green colors mark angles of the pelvis for the 1st and 2nd group. Furthermore we can compare the actual time series for the two intervals. The figure below shows 25 plots for each of the trials with the red/orange color marking the 2nd interval and green the 1st. Vertical lines show boundaries for the four sub-movements within each interval, horizontal lines show mean values of the ribcage (green for the 1st interval and orange for the 2nd) and a blue horizontal line marks the ribcage angle in the 1st frame of the trial than a person is in a straight position (to compensate for the different orientation of the body we add 90 degree). Horizontal axis is given in frames with sampling frequency 120 frames per second. Green colors are for the 1st interval (4-7th sub-movements; left to right bow stance) and red-like for the 2nd interval (8-11th sub-movements; right to left bow stance); darker colors are for the pelvis and lighter colors for the ribcage; olive color for the (pelvis-ribcage) value in the 1st interval and pink color in the 2nd.
